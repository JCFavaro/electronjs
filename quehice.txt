Certainly! Let me explain the purpose of each of the three files in the project:

    main.js:
        This file is the main entry point for your Electron application.
        It sets up the Electron app, creates a browser window, and loads the index.html file.
        It also handles the IPC (Inter-Process Communication) communication between the main process and the renderer process.
        The main process is responsible for managing the application's lifecycle and interacting with the operating system.
        In this file, we create a window using the BrowserWindow class and load the index.html file using the loadFile method.
        We also listen for the send-request event from the renderer process and use the axios library to make the HTTP request. 
        The response is then sent back to the renderer process using the receive-response event.

    index.html:
        This file is the main HTML file for your Electron application.
        It contains the structure and content of the user interface.
        In this file, we have a form with input fields for the URL, method, and request body.
        When the form is submitted, it triggers an event listener in the renderer process to handle the request.
        The response from the server is displayed in the response div.

    renderer.js:
        This file is executed in the renderer process, which is responsible for rendering the user interface.
        It handles the form submission event and sends the request data to the main process using IPC communication.
        It also listens for the receive-response event from the main process and updates the UI with the response data.
        In this file, we use the fetch API to make the HTTP request in the renderer process.
        When the response is received, it is parsed as JSON and displayed in the response div.

These three files work together to create a simple Electron application that simulates Postman and allows you to make HTTP requests. 
The main process manages the application's lifecycle and handles the HTTP requests, while the renderer process renders the user interface 
and communicates with the main process using IPC.
